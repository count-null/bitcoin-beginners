# Bitcoin Wallets

Wallets are tools that help you store and spend your bitcoin. A common
misconception is that bitcoins are stored in a wallet. Bitcoins are not "stored"
in any one place in particular. They exist on the blockchain, a shared database
of who owns what bitcoins. Remember, to own bitcoin means that you posses the
private key required to spend that bitcoin.

So what exactly do wallets do? Wallets help you manage your bitcoin. Wallets are
tools for storing your private keys and signing bitcoin transactions.

Wallets come in many forms. Since a private key is just a special kind of number,
there are an infinite number of ways to store a private key. However, in order to
create a transaction (a.k.a. spend some bitcoin associated with a private key)
a device is required to sign the transaction and broadcast it over the internet
for the computers running the bitcoin network to verify and approve the transaction.

Some wallets can only store private keys.

## Paper Wallets

A paper wallet is just what it's name implies. Its a piece of paper with the
private key written on it. Obviously, a paper wallet cannot create a transaction,
but it can store your keys to your bitcoin.

A paper wallet is easy to make but it's not very convenient. You'd have to manually
type in the key to a wallet that can create transactions in order to spend from a
paper wallet. Paper also isn't the most durable. Remember, if you loose your keys,
the bitcoin associated with them is lost forever.

You can also make "paper wallets" out of engraved metal or more durable materials.

## Hardware Wallets

A hardware wallet is a special device designed to store Bitcoin private keys. Some
hardware wallets can connect to the internet and broadcast transactions. Other
hardware wallets can even run a fully validating node to verify all your transactions
without trusting anyone.

When a wallet can connect to the internet, it's called a hot wallet. Its hot because
its ready to create a transaction at any time. Hot wallets are less secure since
they're open to hackers who may want to steal your funds. if someone hacks your
wallet and steals your keys, they can spend your bitcoin without you even knowing.

When a wallet cannot connect to the internet, it's called a cold wallet. Bitcoin
keys on a cold wallet are said to be in "cold storage" since they are not able
to be signed and bitcoin cannot be spent while not online. Cold wallets are much
more secure.

Some cold wallets can sign a transaction without being connected to the internet.
They create a file with all the transaction data inside. That file can be sent to
a hot wallet where it is then broadcast to the network.

Hardware wallets are just tiny computers running special software. You can buy a
hardware wallet form a company like CoinKite or Trezor. You can even make your own
using off the shelf parts and open source software.

## Mobile Wallets

A mobile wallet is an app that runs on your smartphone. Using the hardware built-in
to your phone, a mobile wallet lets you easily send and receive bitcoin by scanning
QR codes.

Of course, if your phone connects to the internet, a mobile wallet is a hot wallet
so it should only be used to store bitcoins that you are prepared to loose in case
you get hacked. Also, if you don't keep backups of your private key, then if your
phone breaks or gets lost or stolen, then you also lost any bitcoin you had on it.

## Desktop Wallets

Similar to mobile wallets, a desktop wallet is an application that runs on your PC.
Desktops tend to have more available storage space and more stable internet access.
This makes desktops ideal for running a full node. Many desktop wallets will also
allow you to run a fully validating node.

## Web Wallets / Exchanges

When you buy bitcoin from an online exchange, the exchange will hold that bitcoin
for you in one of their web wallets. Most exchanges will allow you withdraw to your
personal wallet after you make the purchase.

When you let bitcoin sit in an exchange, you do not own that bitcoin. You don't
know the private key, so you don't own it. As the saying goes, "Not your keys,
not your coins". A web wallet is very convenient and the exchange will usually
allow you to send and receive funds from the web wallet that they provide.

A web wallet should only be relied on for beginners. Its a good solution until
you can get another wallet to self-custody your funds. Until then you are trusting
the exchange to actually give you your money. You are also trusting that they actually
have the money in the first place.

For these reasons, you should not a lot of money on exchanges for any extended
period of time.

## Brain Wallets

You can always just memorize your private key. In it's default form, a
private key is a long sting of numbers and letters but you can also represent a
private key with a list of 12 or 24 words. This makes it much easier to remember.

Of course, memory isn't perfect. A brain wallet should never be used in practice.
However, imagine trying to cross the border with all your wealth. If you carry
physical cash, gold, or any other kind of bitcoin wallet, that can be seized by
the border guards. With bitcoin it's possible to walk across the border completely
naked and sill have possession of all your wealth.

Not every bitcoin wallet will fall neatly into one of those categories. There's
an abundance of possible ways to store and spend your bitcoin. Start with the
one that you feel most comfortable with and over time experiment with other options
until you find what works best for you.

Each kind of wallet has its own advantages and disadvantages, and remember, bitcoin
is still very young. New and better wallets are always being developed.
