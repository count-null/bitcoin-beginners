# What is Currency?

Many things have been used as currency. Ancient civilizations used gold coins,
prisoner's use cigarettes, nations use paper bills backed by the state, and video
games use points. Just about anything can be used as a currency and traded for
goods and services.

# The Roles of Money

Whenever something is used as a currency, its because it fulfills the three roles
of a good money.

1. Store of Value
2. Medium of Exchange
3. Unit of Account

Let's define each of these roles that make a good money.

## Store of Value

A good money maintains its value over time. This enables people to save and spend
the money at a later date without penalty.

## Medium of Exchange

A good money can be used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services. It
provides a common ground for determining value.

## Unit of Account

A good money is used as the standard numerical unit for measuring the value of
goods and services. When a money is the unit of account, all prices are measured
in terms of the currency.

Additionally, the roles of money build off of one another. You cannot have a money
which is a unit of account without also being a store of value.

A good money has to be a store of value first. That way people will use it to
store their wealth and to save. Only then, can a money become a medium of exchange.
Once it becomes a medium of exchange, only then can it be widely used to measure
prices, becoming a unit of account.

So what makes something a good store of value? What causes people to use a money
as a medium of exchange? And how does a money become used for marking prices?

# The Properties of Money

In addition to the three roles that money plays, money also can have several
properties that allow it to achieve those roles.

1. Durability
2. Scarcity
3. Fungibility
4. Portability
5. Divisibility
6. Acceptability

Let's define each of the properties that a good money can have.

## Durability

A good money has to be durable -- able to withstand being used many times. It may
even have to survive a few cycles in the washing machine.

## Scarcity

A good money is scarce -- the supply in circulation must be limited to maintain
a constant value. When a money isn't scarce, inflation occurs.

## Fungibility

A good money has to be fungible -- one unit has to be interchangeable with another.
Apples, for example, are not fungible because one apple can be better than another.

## Portability

A good money is portable -- it fits in your pocket. This makes it convenient to
trade.

## Divisibility

A good money is divisible -- able to be divided into smaller units. This allows
the same money to buy everything from a house to a piece of chewing gum.

## Acceptability

A good money is widely acceptable -- people are willing and able to accept it
as payment.

These properties are what allow something to achieve the roles of a good money.

## Is it money?

- Is gold money?

Gold is a good store of value because it's durable and scarce.

Gold is a good medium of exchange because it's fungible and portable.

Gold is a good unit of account because it's divisible and widely accepted.

- Are houses money?

Houses are a good store of value because they can be used for generations (durable),
and they are scarce.

But houses are not portable, or fungible -- all houses are not valued the same.
Therefore, houses are not a medium of exchange.

Houses are not money.

- Is fiat money?

Fiat currencies are a decent store of value - they are durable and while the amount
in circulation is always increasing (causing inflation) there is still a limited amount.

Fiat currencies are a good medium of exchange - they are portable in the form of
paper bills and extremely portable in the form of digital account balances and credit.
Fiat is fungible.

Fiat currencies are used as the unit of account within its nation state. The state
demands payment of taxes in the currency helping to make the currency widely
acceptable for payment. Fiat currencies are also divisible enough to pay for most goods.

- Is Bitcoin money?

Its too soon to call Bitcoin a store of value although, it certainly acts like one.
Bitcoin's price is very volatile but it trends upwards. Every year, the lowest
value of a bitcoin is higher than the year before. Bitcoins are certainly scarce
and a bitcoin never wears out.

Since we can't call Bitcoin a store of value yet, we also can't call it a medium
of exchange. However, bitcoin is mostly fungible (we'll see why it's not purely
fungible today in the privacy section) and it's very portable.

Bitcoin certainly isn't a unit of account today. Its value fluctuates too much for
most people to accept it. However, bitcoin is much more divisible than any other
money we have. This allows sending tiny fractions of a penny to pay for things
you might not have imagined that someone could be paid for. (See micro-transactions
section)
