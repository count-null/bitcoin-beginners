# You can Own a Fraction of a Bitcoin

You can own a fraction of a bitcoin. It's worth repeating because many people
take one look at the price of one bitcoin and think it's out of their reach.

In fact, a single bitcoin can be divided into
one hundred million units called satoshis or sats for short. For nearly a decade
after bitcoin was created, people didn't really use sats as a unit. The value of
a sat was just so insignificant because Bitcoin wasn't worth very much. In 2010,
someone famously bought a pizza for 10,000 BTC after all.

However, as the value of Bitcoin began to rise exponentially, the cost of everyday
goods was better represented as fractions of a bitcoin. That same 10k BTC pizza
would have sold in 2014 for just 0.05 BTC.

For a short time, the Millibit was used to denote smaller values of bitcoin. One
millibit (1 mBit) equals 0.001 BTC or one one-thousandth of a bitcoin. The millibit
never really caught on and the price of bitcoin continued to rise.

People were hesitant to use the sat for measuring units of bitcoin because for a
a long time, it didn't make sense to send someone just a couple of sats. You see,
every bitcoin transaction has a fee. If you wanted to send someone 1000 sats,
you would pay more than 1000 sats in fees. It just wasn't worth making a bitcoin
transaction unless it was at least a millibit.

## Sats the Standard

Everything changed in 2018 when development of the lightning network began. The
lightning network is a layer built on top of bitcoin that extends what you can
do with it. Sort of like how a web browser is a layer on top of your operating
system that allows you to access the web. The lightning network enabled people
to send micro transactions in bitcoin for very low fees. For the first time, it
actually made economic sense to send a single sat. The lightning network vastly
improved the usability of bitcoin for making everyday transactions because the
payments are approved instantly.

In 2019, the sat began to take hold in the bitcoin community as the meme "Sats
the Standard" spread. Today, many exchanges and services either show bitcoin amounts
in sats by default or provide some toggle for the user to choose to display in
sats or fractions of bitcoin.

As the price of bitcoin keeps pumping, it will only make more and more sense to
use a smaller unit of measurement.

This book uses bitcoin and sats interchangeably just as someone might use dollars
and cents when they are talking about different amount of fiat money.
