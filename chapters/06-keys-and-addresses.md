# How do you own Bitcoin?

To own some bitcoin means that you own a key that has unspent bitcoin associated
with it. The Bitcoin blockchain is just a global database that keeps track of
which keys hae how much bitcoin. If you own a key with some bitcoin, you can
spend the bitcoin associated with that key.

Specifically, this key is called a private key. Its private because you don't
want anyone to ever know it. Since simply knowing the key is enough to move the
bitcoins to another key that you do not control.

A private key is usually represented as a string of random numbers and
letters. But a private key is really just a number. A very, very, very large
number. That string of characters is just a more efficient way to represent the
number.

Since owning Bitcoin just means that you know (or have access to) a special number,
this makes it really easy to hold bitcoins without depending on anyone else.
You could store your private key on a piece of paper, etch it on a metal plate,
use fancy algorithms to transform the key into a 12-word phrase that you could
memorize, you can put it on a USB drive, the possibilities are limitless.

Just be sure that however you store your private key, that it's safe, private
and that you don't loose it!
