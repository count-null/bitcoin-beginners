# Bitcoin & Energy

Bitcoin has always received criticism for the amount of energy it uses.
As we learned in the previous chapter on Bitcoin mining, the security of Bitcoin's
decentralized network depends on hordes of energy consuming machines performing
a computationally expensive proof-of-work (PoW) task.

Most people's initial reaction to this is negative. At first it sounds
unsustainable maybe even unethical for Bitcoin to "hog" all of this perfectly
good energy. The truth is most of us don't have an intuitive understanding of
what energy actually is and how it gets created and delivered to our cities and
homes.

Understanding this along with the role bitcoin mining plays in the energy landscape,
hints at a beautiful future where bitcoin and energy production grow and evolve together.

## Myth: Energy use is bad

Fact: Energy is the fundamental currency for all life across all scales in the
universe.

Economic growth for the past two centuries has been driven largely by the
declining cost of energy.

Cheaper energy means more people can afford to use it to heat their homes,
power their washing machines, lights, cars, computers, and ultimately improve
their quality of life. Industries can afford to automate their processes with
energy consuming technology to make goods more cheaply. This drives the cost of
goods down for the consumer -- effectively making everyone in society richer.

When energy gets cheaper, more energy gets used. When more energy gets used,
quality of life improves for everyone.

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is neither created nor destroyed.
Energy can only be transformed and there is an infinite supply of energy just waiting
for humanity to harness it.

People who claim that energy use is inherently bad are probably mistaking "energy"
with fossil fuels and non-renewables which represent only a single source of energy.
These people have a mindset of scarcity. They believe that energy can run out, that
we as a society must ration our energy carefully.

While non-renewables continue to supply most of the world's energy,
sustainable sources like wind, solar, and nuclear are abundant. Nuclear energy alone
could power the earth for hundreds of thousands of years with current supplies.
Additionally, the sun powers all life on this planet. The amount of sunlight that
falls on the earth in a single hour could meet all of humanity's energy needs for
a year. We are just starting to harness these renewable energy sources and bitcoin
could be the incentive needed to launch us into the clean energy revolution.

## Myth: Bitcoin wastes energy on useless calculations

Fact: The energy bitcoin consumes goes directly to providing a public good: online
peer-to-peer payments infrastructure that anyone on Earth with a smartphone
and internet connection can use.

People who don't understand the computer science breakthrough of PoW think that
bitcoin miners only do one thing: burn energy in an attempt to get rich. After all,
miners only do two things:

1. spend lots of energy trying to guess the lucky number
2. the winner gets to tally the recently added transactions and write them to the blockchain

A single laptop from 10 years ago is plenty powerful enough to process every
bitcoin transaction that happens today. Adding transactions to the chain is easy.
Deciding who should be allowed to add transactions without a central authority
is hard.

Bitcoin was the first to solve this long-standing computer science problem. It
does this by:

1. Picking a miner using a lottery,

2. A winner is picked every 10 minutes.

3. To be picked you have to perform some costly computing work (lottery tickets
   have a cost).

4. Miners who try to put invalid transactions into the blockchain will be rejected
   by the rest of the network.

The amount of energy consumed is what protects the network from attack because an
attacker would have to harness more than 50% of the total energy of the network in
order to achieve a majority hash rate and overrule the honest miners who would
otherwise reject fraud.

For Bitcoin, energy use is a good thing. The more energy it consumes, the harder
it becomes for any one attacker to command the energy required to attack it. The
amount of energy used by Bitcoin has grown year over year and will probably continue
to grow indefinitely. Thus the security of the network gets stronger and stronger --
able to protect and transfer more of the world's value.

## Myth: Bitcoin hurts the environment

Fact: Bitcoin doesn't waste energy. It consumes energy waste.

It is true that Bitcoin uses more energy than many small countries. Journalists
love to use this fact to argue that bitcoin is wasting energy. Their argument
assumes that if bitcoin didn't exist, the energy it uses would instead
be made available for other "more productive" things. The reality is that bitcoin
gets most of its energy from sources that would otherwise go to waste.

Bitcoin miners are unique from other energy consumers because they are
location independent. Wind, solar, and geothermal energy farms are often located
far away from the cities who demand the most energy. Moving energy from point A
to point B requires very expensive infrastructure that leaves many remote energy
sources left untaped because transporting the electricity would not be profitable.

Bitcoin miners are highly portable. They go wherever the electricity is. This enables
once unprofitable energy-rich sites to become profitable if they're used to mine
bitcoin -- effectively allowing mining companies to capitalize on wasted energy.

Even the power plants that burn oil, gas, and coal could mine bitcoin in a "green" way.
Power plants that serve cities have enormous amounts of wasted energy. This is
because no power plant is perfectly efficient. Excess capacity must be generated
to meet demands that are constantly fluctuating from season to season, day to day,
and hour to hour.

That excess capacity is effectively grounded on the spot -- natural gas plants
flare their excess gas by just lighting it on fire or worse, releaseing it directly
into the atmosphere. Storing extra electricity in batteries is unfeasible at the
scale these plants operate. Plus, batteries are not very efficient at storing power.
Power plants take this waste into account as a necessary business expense to provide
reliable service.

Bitcoin mining allows power companies to profit off the excess energy. They simply
need a rack of mining equipment configured to scale up and down as the excess
capacity fluctuates. Theoretically, Bitcoin mining could make most power plants
100% efficient.

Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment forces miners to be as competitive as possible.
If a mining operator finds a way to get electricity for a penny less than his
competitors, he will be able to afford more miners, increasing the hash rate,
increasing the difficulty, driving out the competition. In the long run, every
miner will have to get their energy for nearly free just to break even.

Today, a lot of Bitcoin mining happens in China. This is because electricity in
China is very cheap. It is subsidized by the Chinese government which makes the
price artificially low. This is bad in the short term because China's electric
grid depends almost entirely on coal and oil. China has banned bitcoin mining
but bitcoin's decentralized nature makes it very hard to enforce the ban. Bitcoin
mining remains profitable in China and many mining farms operate there illegally.
This is not sustainable and will either end when China stops manipulating prices,
or renewables are able to compete with the artificially low prices.

In 2019, 78% of global bitcoin mining used renewable energy sources. Meanwhile,
renewable energy made up only 18% of total global energy usage. The Bitcoin Revolution
may coincide with a Green Energy Revolution and the switch from a financial system run
by government institutions to one run by the people, the laws of thermodynamics,
and math may be greener than you think.

## Myth: There are more energy efficient money systems

Fact: Bitcoin is positioned to become the most efficient money system we've ever
had.

Sounds crazy right. The truth is that the systems we have today are just as guilty
of outlandish energy consumption as bitcoin, perhaps even more so. Bitcoin makes
itself an easy target for criticism because of its transparency. We can make
precise estimations for how much energy bitcoin consumes because of how closely
energy costs relate to mining expenses. A mining company will spend anywhere from
30-70% of their operating costs on electricity alone. From this kind of information,
we can calculate how much energy gets used by the Bitcoin network.

Surely a credit card transaction uses less energy than bitcoin, right?

When you swipe your credit card, you have not created a fully settled transaction.
When the card reader chimes to tell you to remove your card, you have only received
authorization to make a payment that goes through a complicated dance involving at
least five other players (the cardholder, the card issuing bank, the card network,
the merchant acquiring bank, and the merchant). After a few days or weeks, that
payment will get processed by each of those players and show up on your credit
card statement. The transaction doesn't actually get settled until you pay your
credit card bill.

In contrast, a bitcoin transaction gets settled the second it gets added to the
blockchain (10 mins on average). Your bitcoin transaction doesn't go through any
middlemen. The miner who placed that block with your transaction probably used a
lot of electricity but it used much less than a handful of Fortune 500 corporations
operating at full tilt for a couple of days.

Trying to calculate the energy use of a corporation is hard. Sure there's the
cost of their electric bill, but that's only part of the true energy cost that
these complex and inefficient systems incur. What about the energy required to
build a skyscraper in every major city? What about the coffee beans supplying energy
to all the employees of these institutions? How about the gasoline these employees
used to commute to work? All of these unnecessary expenses can be replaced by clever
math executed in code. Bitcoin is the only system to pull this off and the
competition has yet to realize that this new player is even a threat.   

Even when comparing Bitcoin to gold, the energy cost of mining gold is enormous
compared to what bitcoin can operate with. Moving millions of tons of earth and
rock takes incredible sums of energy and it is directly harmful to the ecology
of our planet.

## Extra: What about proof of stake?

Maybe you can accept that Bitcoin is more energy efficient than the alternatives.
By what about other cryptocurrencies? Can we have a digital currency that uses
almost no energy to secure its network? Many alt-coins have switched (or are currently
switching) to a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism in order to differentiate themselves
from the "inefficient" Bitcoin.

With Proof of Stake (PoS) miners are replaced by "stakers" and hashing power is
replaced by staked (or locked) coins. In PoW, your power as a miner depends on
how many hashes (guesses) your miners can make each second. To get more power
(a larger hash rate) you have to invest more money in mining equipment and find
abundant sources of cheap electricity. In PoS, your power as a staker depends on
how much money (cryptocurrency) you have stored in a locked account. To get more
power in PoS, you have to deposit more funds to the account.

Both of these consensus systems are trying to achieve something called "unforgeable
costliness". To earn the power to decide what transactions belongs in a block, you
need to prove that you have personally invested in the system -- you need unforgeable
costliness. With PoW systems like Bitcoin, miners invest in the network by buying
and running expensive hardware. With PoS systems, stakers invest in the network by
locking up funds in accounts. Miners get rewarded by winning the block reward and
collecting transaction fees. Stakers get rewarded with transaction fees paid as
interest, just like a savings account.

Proof of Stake does require some cost to get more power. Namely, the opportunity
cost of locking up funds. However, the costs incurred are not unforgeable and
Proof of Stake has tradeoffs that may affect the long-term viability of the networks
it governs.

The reasons why proof of stake falls short might seem like 1-in-a-million events.
It might even seem worth the risk if the energy use is much lower than the
alternatives. However, the goal of all cryptocurrency is to fulfill the role
of money for the digital age.

If the goal is global digital money, we must treat the software as we would the
software of nuclear reactors. In engineering, this class of software is called a
"critical system" -- there's safety critical, mission critical, and business critical.
Money fulfills all three. A loss of money can cause loss of life. For every major
engineering disaster in history, the cause of failure was the result of multiple
unlikely events coming together in an unfortunate coincidence (The Fukushima Meltdown,
The Challenger Disaster, and Chernobyl are recent examples).

With that said, Proof of Stake has two major flaws:

1. The inability to recover from large chain splits
2. The theft of keys to gain control

If a large part of a PoS network goes offline, the network will have trouble determining
which segment holds the correct state. This could happen if a country like China
decides to censor its internet, blocking all nodes within its territory from
communicating with the rest of the world. Even if the nodes find some other way to
communicate (using VPNs, satellites or radio waves) those nodes will still have
an older version of the chain and the network as a whole will have trouble agreeing
on which is really the most recent chain. This could cause many people to loose
money that they received during the time the network was split.  

In PoW, nodes will agree on whichever chain has the most proof of work (the longest
chain).

The second problem is what makes PoS fail to achieve unforgeable costliness. The
assumption is that in order to gain power, you must have purchased or earned coins.
You prove that you did this by depositing those coins into an account. However,
just because you own some coins, does not mean that you earned them or that they
cost you anything at all.

Remember, owning bitcoin just means that you own the private key associated with
some amount of bitcoin. The same is true for alt-coins. This means an attacker of
a PoS chain could just steal the coins of a major staker and use those stolen coins
to exert power over the network.

This isn't a problem with Bitcoin. While someone could also steal bitcoin from a
very wealthy bitcoiner, in order to use those coins to attack the network, he would
have to spend them on lots of mining equipment, and find and pay for enough power
to run them.
