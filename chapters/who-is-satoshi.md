# Who is Satoshi?

The creator of Bitcoin is known only as Satoshi Nakamoto. This anonymous internet
user was very active in email groups and forums where he would write about his
vision for Bitcoin. In 2011, Satoshi announced that he would be leaving the
community he had created never to return. He was confident that Bitcoin had
grown enough to sustain itself without a leader and just like that he mysteriously
disappeared never to be heard from again.

There are many theories about Satoshi's identity and people are still trying to
uncover clues that may reveal who he/she/they was.

While Satoshi Nakamoto is a Japanese-sounding name, its more likely that Satoshi
was from the United States. Satoshi was most active online when it was daytime in
the east coast of the US and he was mostly inactive at night. Additionally, his
english was perfect -- so much so that his writings may have been peer reviewed
by a team of people.

In **year** a Japanese man named Satoshi Nakamoto was discovered by the media but
he honestly had no idea about Bitcoin and he didn't even know how to code so it
was labeled a coincidence.

Satoshi's mysterious and god-like nature has caused many people to theorize that
satoshi was an alien or super-powerful artificial intelligence that blessed
humanity with the gift of Bitcoin.

However, Satoshi was most likely a cryptographer residing in California named
Hal Finney. Hal was the first person to Tweet about bitcoin. He and Satoshi created
the first bitcoin transaction and Hal had all the technical know-how to build bitcoin.

Hal sadly passed away from **disease** in **year** shortly after Satoshi announced
he would be leaving.

Satoshi knew that it was important for him to remain anonymous. He knew that
one day, Bitcoin would be a threat to government's control over money and that
any leader trying to take this control would be in serious danger.

Even though there are many other cryptocurrencies today, none except for bitcoin
has an anonymous founder and continues to survive and thrive without a leader.
