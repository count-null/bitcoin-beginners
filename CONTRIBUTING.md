# Contributing to The Bitcoin Owner's Manual

The Bitcoin Owner's Manual book operates an open contributor model where anyone
is welcome to contribute in the form of peer review, authoring, editing and
technical development. This document explains the practical process and guidelines
for contributing.

First, in terms of community structure, there is no particular concept of privileged
people. Open source often naturally revolves around a meritocracy where contributors
earn trust from the developer community over time. Nevertheless, some hierarchy
is necessary for practical purposes. As such, there are repository "maintainers"
who are responsible for merging pull requests and ensuring all the contributions
come together to create a cohesive and engaging educational resource.

## Getting Started

New contributors are very welcome and needed.

Since this repository is for a book aimed at beginners to bitcoin, we expect many
readers may wish to contribute and that it may be their first ever open source
contribution.

Peer reviewing and editing is highly valued and and the most effective way you can
contribute as a new contributor.

### Good First Issue Label

The purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable
for a new contributor without a deep understanding of Bitcoin or code.

However, good first issues can be solved by anyone. If they remain unsolved for
a longer time, a frequent contributor might address them.

You do not need to request permission to start working on an issue. However,
you are encouraged to leave a comment if you are planning to work on it.
This will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed
and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.

Check out the `issues` tab to view open issues or create a new one.

### Communication Channels

Discussion about writing or codebase improvements happens in GitHub issues and pull requests.

### Contributor Workflow

The codebase and content is maintained using the "contributor workflow" where everyone without
exception contributes patch proposals using "pull requests" (PRs). This facilitates
social contribution, easy testing and peer review.

To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:

Fork repository ([only for the first time](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo))
Create topic branch
Commit patches

The project coding conventions in the developer notes must be followed.

## Types of Contributions

A lot of different skills are required to make a great book. Even if you aren't
a bitcoin expert or have any coding skills, your input is still valuable.

Here are some of the ways you can contribute:

### Create an Issue

Anyone may create a new issue to address any improvement to the project. Peers
may comment on the issue for clarification or discussion and if it is deemed worthy
by the peers, someone may create a pull request that addresses the issue.

### Peer Review

Anyone may participate in peer review which is expressed by comments in the
pull request or issue. Typically reviewers will review the code for obvious errors,
and discuss the merits of a particular issue and how it should be resolved. Project
maintainers take into account the peer review when determining if there is consensus
to merge a pull request.

### Editing

Anyone may create a pull request that addresses an existing issue or a one off change
that addresses an obvious error (like spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc.) Editors
may also make large structural changes to how the content of the book is presented.
Changes will be peer reviewed before being merged.

### Authorship

Anyone may author new chapters or provide additional sections within existing chapters
of the book. These additions may be in response to an existing issue or proposed
at the sole discretion of the author. Additions will be peer reviewed before being merged.

### Artwork

Anyone may contribute artwork to the book. This includes cover designs for each year's
edition as well as illustrations, graphs, charts, etc. shown within the book. Artists
are welcome to make pull requests that incorporate their art or work with other contributors.
If you're an artist who would like to contribute, create an issue explaining your
intent. Someone will work with you to add your artwork into the codebase.

### Code Changes

Anyone may contribute code. This project uses [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)
to generate the web and print versions of the book. We welcome any contributions
that simplify the process.
