# Bitcoin Beginners Guide

This is a collection of short articles that cover key topics, answer common questions, and help beginners avoid common gotchas about using and investing in Bitcoin. This project is designed to introduce you to the lingo and high-level concepts in Bitcoin so you can ask better questions (Google is your friend!)

Don't trust, verify! Always do your own research (DYOR) if you accept what you read here as fact, you are trusing someone. Everything here is peer-reviewed and fact-checked, but some things are simplified and nuance is sometimes ignored. 

We we're all Bitcoin Beginners at one point. Many of us had to learn the hard way. We paid our tuition in the form of lost coins, bad trades, and by not buying enough Bitcoin! We want to help newbies avoid our mistakes.
