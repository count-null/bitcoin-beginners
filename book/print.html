                        <h1><a class="header" href="#what-is-bitcoin" id="what-is-bitcoin">What is Bitcoin?</a></h1>
<p>Bitcoin is a new kind of currency. USD is for United States Dollar, EUR is for
the Euro, and BTC is for Bitcoin. Those other currencies are called Fiat
Currencies and they are created by governments. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by
an anonymous internet user known only as Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>Satoshi released a document called &quot;Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash
System&quot; to a small internet mailing list of cryptography experts. Soon after that
he published the first Bitcoin code. A few people decided to run it and bitcoin
has grown into a global financial network run completely by software and unable
to be controlled by governments.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is software that anyone can download and run to join the network. There
are many types of software that people can choose to run and each serves a
purpose in making Bitcoin work.</p>
<p>Today, you can buy bitcoin, and send it to anyone in the world, instantly,
secretly, and with a less than 1% fee.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is very new technology. It can be tricky to use and requires some
technical know-how. Most places don't accept Bitcoin either. But every year, it
gets easier to use and more business choose to accept bitcoin.</p>
<p>Lucky for you, Bitcoin is very easy to own.</p>
<p>You can hold BTC for years without doing a thing. Then one day you might decide
to use it. By then, it will be easier to use and it might even be more valuable.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has a price. In 2009 Bitcoin didn't have a price. It was just an
experiment then. In <strong>_</strong> someone started selling Bitcoin on a currency exchange.
That allowed anyone to buy and sell bitcoin for other curencies. Since then, the
price of a Bitcoin has been determined entirely by supply and demand. The price
of Bitcoin is a relection of how much people demand it.</p>
<p>Bitcoin's price is volitile. This is because its supply is scarce and also
because it's so new. The rate at which new bitcoins are being created is slowing
down. This is by design. Eventually, there will be no new bitcoins created and
we'll all have to use what's already in circulation. Bitcoin's total supply is
fixed at 21 million coins.</p>
<p>However, you can buy a fraction of a Bitcoin. In fact, a single Bitcoin can be
divided into 100 million units. The smallest unit of a bitcoin is called a sat
(short for Satoshi).</p>
<p>At first people used to price things BTC. For example, someone famously spent
10,000 BTC for a pizza. However as the price of Bitcoin continued to rise, it
started to make less and less sense to price things in BTC. Today a pizza would
cost <strong>__</strong> BTC or <strong>_</strong> SATS. It's easier to price small purchaces in SATS.</p>
<p>Terminology:</p>
<p>BTC is the ticker symbol
Bitcoin with a capital &quot;B&quot; refers to the network -- all the computers and code
that makes Bitcoin work.
bitcoin with a lowercase &quot;b&quot; refers to the currency. E.x. I recieved some bitcoin
from my friend Tom.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#you-can-own-a-fraction-of-a-bitcoin" id="you-can-own-a-fraction-of-a-bitcoin">You can Own a Fraction of a Bitcoin</a></h1>
<p>You can own a fraction of a bitcoin. It's worth repeating because many people
take one look at the price of one bitcoin and think it's out of their reach.</p>
<p>In fact, a single bitcoin can be divided into
one hundred million units called satoshis or sats for short. For nearly a decade
after bitcoin was created, people didn't really use sats as a unit. The value of
a sat was just so insignificant because Bitcoin wasn't worth very much. In 2010,
someone famously bought a pizza for 10,000 BTC after all.</p>
<p>However, as the value of Bitcoin began to rise exponentially, the cost of everyday
goods was better represented as fractions of a bitcoin. That same 10k BTC pizza
would have sold in 2014 for just 0.05 BTC.</p>
<p>For a short time, the Millibit was used to denote smaller values of bitcoin. One
millibit (1 mBit) equals 0.001 BTC or one one-thousandth of a bitcoin. The millibit
never really caught on and the price of bitcoin continued to rise.</p>
<p>People were hesitant to use the sat for measuring units of bitcoin because for a
a long time, it didn't make sense to send someone just a couple of sats. You see,
every bitcoin transaction has a fee. If you wanted to send someone 1000 sats,
you would pay more than 1000 sats in fees. It just wasn't worth making a bitcoin
transaction unless it was at least a millibit.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#sats-the-standard" id="sats-the-standard">Sats the Standard</a></h2>
<p>Everything changed in 2018 when development of the lightning network began. The
lightning network is a layer built on top of bitcoin that extends what you can
do with it. Sort of like how a web browser is a layer on top of your operating
system that allows you to access the web. The lightning network enabled people
to send micro transactions in bitcoin for very low fees. For the first time, it
actually made economic sense to send a single sat. The lightning network vastly
improved the usability of bitcoin for making everyday transactions because the
payments are approved instantly.</p>
<p>In 2019, the sat began to take hold in the bitcoin community as the meme &quot;Sats
the Standard&quot; spread. Today, many exchanges and services either show bitcoin amounts
in sats by default or provide some toggle for the user to choose to display in
sats or fractions of bitcoin.</p>
<p>As the price of bitcoin keeps pumping, it will only make more and more sense to
use a smaller unit of measurement.</p>
<p>This book uses bitcoin and sats interchangeably just as someone might use dollars
and cents when they are talking about different amount of fiat money.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#what-is-currency" id="what-is-currency">What is Currency?</a></h1>
<p>Many things have been used as currency. Ancient civilizations used gold coins,
prisoner's use cigarettes, nations use paper bills backed by the state, and video
games use points. Just about anything can be used as a currency and traded for
goods and services.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-roles-of-money" id="the-roles-of-money">The Roles of Money</a></h1>
<p>Whenever something is used as a currency, its because it fulfills the three roles
of a good money.</p>
<ol>
<li>Store of Value</li>
<li>Medium of Exchange</li>
<li>Unit of Account</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's define each of these roles that make a good money.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#store-of-value" id="store-of-value">Store of Value</a></h2>
<p>A good money maintains its value over time. This enables people to save and spend
the money at a later date without penalty.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#medium-of-exchange" id="medium-of-exchange">Medium of Exchange</a></h2>
<p>A good money can be used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services. It
provides a common ground for determining value.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#unit-of-account" id="unit-of-account">Unit of Account</a></h2>
<p>A good money is used as the standard numerical unit for measuring the value of
goods and services. When a money is the unit of account, all prices are measured
in terms of the currency.</p>
<p>Additionally, the roles of money build off of one another. You cannot have a money
which is a unit of account without also being a store of value.</p>
<p>A good money has to be a store of value first. That way people will use it to
store their wealth and to save. Only then, can a money become a medium of exchange.
Once it becomes a medium of exchange, only then can it be widely used to measure
prices, becoming a unit of account.</p>
<p>So what makes something a good store of value? What causes people to use a money
as a medium of exchange? And how does a money become used for marking prices?</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-properties-of-money" id="the-properties-of-money">The Properties of Money</a></h1>
<p>In addition to the three roles that money plays, money also can have several
properties that allow it to achieve those roles.</p>
<ol>
<li>Durability</li>
<li>Scarcity</li>
<li>Fungibility</li>
<li>Portability</li>
<li>Divisibility</li>
<li>Acceptability</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's define each of the properties that a good money can have.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#durability" id="durability">Durability</a></h2>
<p>A good money has to be durable -- able to withstand being used many times. It may
even have to survive a few cycles in the washing machine.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#scarcity" id="scarcity">Scarcity</a></h2>
<p>A good money is scarce -- the supply in circulation must be limited to maintain
a constant value. When a money isn't scarce, inflation occurs.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#fungibility" id="fungibility">Fungibility</a></h2>
<p>A good money has to be fungible -- one unit has to be interchangeable with another.
Apples, for example, are not fungible because one apple can be better than another.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#portability" id="portability">Portability</a></h2>
<p>A good money is portable -- it fits in your pocket. This makes it convenient to
trade.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#divisibility" id="divisibility">Divisibility</a></h2>
<p>A good money is divisible -- able to be divided into smaller units. This allows
the same money to buy everything from a house to a piece of chewing gum.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#acceptability" id="acceptability">Acceptability</a></h2>
<p>A good money is widely acceptable -- people are willing and able to accept it
as payment.</p>
<p>These properties are what allow something to achieve the roles of a good money.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#is-it-money" id="is-it-money">Is it money?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Is gold money?</li>
</ul>
<p>Gold is a good store of value because it's durable and scarce.</p>
<p>Gold is a good medium of exchange because it's fungible and portable.</p>
<p>Gold is a good unit of account because it's divisible and widely accepted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are houses money?</li>
</ul>
<p>Houses are a good store of value because they can be used for generations (durable),
and they are scarce.</p>
<p>But houses are not portable, or fungible -- all houses are not valued the same.
Therefore, houses are not a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>Houses are not money.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is fiat money?</li>
</ul>
<p>Fiat currencies are a decent store of value - they are durable and while the amount
in circulation is always increasing (causing inflation) there is still a limited amount.</p>
<p>Fiat currencies are a good medium of exchange - they are portable in the form of
paper bills and extremely portable in the form of digital account balances and credit.
Fiat is fungible.</p>
<p>Fiat currencies are used as the unit of account within its nation state. The state
demands payment of taxes in the currency helping to make the currency widely
acceptable for payment. Fiat currencies are also divisible enough to pay for most goods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is Bitcoin money?</li>
</ul>
<p>Its too soon to call Bitcoin a store of value although, it certainly acts like one.
Bitcoin's price is very volatile but it trends upwards. Every year, the lowest
value of a bitcoin is higher than the year before. Bitcoins are certainly scarce
and a bitcoin never wears out.</p>
<p>Since we can't call Bitcoin a store of value yet, we also can't call it a medium
of exchange. However, bitcoin is mostly fungible (we'll see why it's not purely
fungible today in the privacy section) and it's very portable.</p>
<p>Bitcoin certainly isn't a unit of account today. Its value fluctuates too much for
most people to accept it. However, bitcoin is much more divisible than any other
money we have. This allows sending tiny fractions of a penny to pay for things
you might not have imagined that someone could be paid for. (See micro-transactions
